      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p>
        I think it's way to hard to select my 50 favorite songs. I will change from day to day and I'm not sure it would be a good playlist, it might not be very diverse. 
        I'm thinking that instead I will try to explain what I listen to, in some case why. There will be a list of bands that I listen to quite much, and I can't include all 
        their good songs so I have picked the one I think is their best. Feel free to ask me to give you a more thourough list of songs for one or more artists, if you want.
        I have also included a list of good songs, either of artists I don't listen to that often or artists that have more or less one or a few good songs.
        The list will probably mainly consist of rock, hard rock, and americana songs.<br /><br />

	  <h1>Musical start</h1>
	  <p>
	    The first things I remember music wise is what my dad used to play. He had some songs that he play on the guitar and sang and then there were some songs he
	    played on the stereo. One song he use to play on the guitar is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YocsxFL5IYM">Johnny Cash - Sugartime</a>, I think I remember it
	    since it's a quite simple song. He used to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f2NO9hYGkg">Jeff Healey - Jambalaya</a> on the stereo, and is still doing
	    that for my niece and nephew, while dancing around with them. There was also a lot of Beatles and Elvis Presley playing in the house. 
	    The two first records I got were by Bryan Adams and Michael Jackson and I had a few of each artist and I should have been about 7 years old at that time. 
	    I've just selected 4 songs, 
	    in case you wouldn't have heard of either of those bands/artists ;)<br />
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDdI7GhZSQA">The Beatles-Hey Jude</a><br />
	    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NupAWDO6axE">Elivs Presley - (Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame</a><br />
	    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP4Nnek6DCo">Bryan Adams - Can't Stop This Thing We Started</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2AitTPI5U0">Michael Jackson - Black Or White</a><br />
        <br />
        A couple of years later I come about a punk band, which got really big in Sweden (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBjn6Y7kA0Q">Dia Psalma</a>).
        That started my musical venture into punk rock and skate punk, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwRmxwh1G7s">Millencolin</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c87TKWgRyCE">Green Day</a> as two of my favorites.
        
        Lastly when visiting my cousin I found that she had a Metallica record, which I started listening to, 
        thinking that was too hard rock for me but liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tj75Arhq5ho">Nothing Else Matters</a> and 
        Unforgiven and that then made me like all of their songs. I've been a fan since then, but am not listening to them that often anymore

	<section>
	  <h1>Americana</h1>
	  <p>
	  I have claimed that I like country, but too be fair it's more americana music in general, with some artists who will be counted towards the country genre
	  As I stated above my dad used to play Johnny Cash to me at a young age, and also had a few other record in that genre, e.g. Merle Haggard.
	  That's probably one reason why I like that kind of music, but I more or less started listening to it 10 years or so ago.
	  I used to listen to Dixie Chicks when riding my bike to work when I lived in California, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbfgxznPmZM">Travelin Soldier</a>
	  as one of the favorites. I also started listening to Eric Church since he had a song on the radio at that time, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3838-EY8Re0">Two pink lines</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
      Another one of the artist in the genre that I started listening to quite early is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AINUPFbFpqg">Steve Earle</a> and then
      later also his son <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf9lvU8_JUo">Justin Townes Earle</a>, which I've seen three or four times when
      he's been playing in Sweden.<br/>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_pRh3aDfUI">Israel Nash Gripka</a> is another artist that I have seen more or less everytime he is
      playing somewhere near where I live. I think I've seen him play 6 times or so and always talk to him when he is
      playing and he offers to put me on the list if I will come to his shows. He is actually playing in Chicago, but it's
      the day I'm flying in so I think I will rather spend that evening with you instead of going to the show.
      </p>
      
	  <p>
      Not to ramble on about every single artist, I can say that I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RelbbYG7H8A">Turnpike Troubadours</a> quite often
      and as I have mentioned, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eWJmN8D820">Sturgill Simpson</a> is a new favorite of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
	  One of Sweden's few country bands <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9Yo9-bRE1A">Willy Clay Band</a>, which I might go see on Friday.<br />
      A few other artist with good songs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNpLSaCirj8">Waylon Jennings - Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gX1EP6mG-E">Old Crow Medicine Show - Wagon Wheel</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgUnUSy4YDs">Band of Horses - Marry Song</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L6XJOjCaAE">The Avett Brothers - Shame</a><br />

	  <h1>Artists I frequently listen to</h1>
	  <p>
      Most of the following artists have in common that most of their songs are really good and bands that I basically won't get tired of
      listening to. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvjmjIzUxUs">Rancid</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Leo9HSaGQ">The Gaslight Anthem</a> are absolutely two
      bands I don't get tired of. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp-gq3fdi_A">The White Buffalo</a> is someone I've
      been listening to for the last year and really like.<br />
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZkFXnm-RNQ">Kaizers Orchestra</a> is a Norwegian band, singing in Norwegian
      but still have really good songs, and since Swedish and Norwegian is quite similar most of their lyrics are 
      understandable to me. Speaking of Norwegian bands, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbrtS8E0kpY">Kvelertak</a> is 
      another band I like and tends to listen to every now and then.
      </p>
      <p>
      I like classic rock music, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS_yyRk_dj8">The Rolling Stones</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLmIlVJYEtw">The White Stripes</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDVAQI-4lto">Foo Fighters</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA1n4oOYLfY">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, and 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz1Jwyxd4tE">The Hives</a>(they're also really good live).
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Then there are some hard rock I find are good, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oB-l4t6Yiw">Guns N' Roses</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3I3-KTJbtY">Slipknot</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkAe30aEG5c">Refused</a>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCWI-t6Etes">Social Distortion</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THobJ_MFagU">Ghost</a>
      </p>
      
      <p>
      There are some of the Britpop bands and type of music too. That would be 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v03BtEzQMxw">Oasis</a>, and 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFE1QEQJ6oY">Mando Diao</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Then there are the rest:<br />
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5bAawsa7_s">Pearl Jam - Just Breathe</a> which a great and this is a really good song.<br />
      
      
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjCw3-YTffo">The Band</a>; a classic band with lots of good songs.<br />
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YLFakwWwt8">Arctic Monkeys</a>, a super good first album and a couple of good songs on the follow up albums.<br />
      A young artist who sings and plays guitar really well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri58RGH931M">Jake Bugg - Me And You</a>.
